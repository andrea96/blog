More than two months has passed since my last post, I had some good ideas I
would have liked to transform into posts but I'm afraid to be too lazy (in my
defence I have to say that I've been really busy). However, maybe because I
bought a new mechanical keyboard, maybe because I'm going to assemble a new pc
for Christmas; this is a new post.

As I preannunced, since I'm building a new pc, I don't want to switch on my new
computer for the first time without knowing which software to install, so the
purpose of this post is to provide a *recipe* with my favorite softwares (and
their configurations).

Obviously the operating system is ArchLinux_, I've been using it for 3-4 years
and I still love it (and this says a lot). I will not give information about the
installation process nor the basic needed configurations, I want to focus on the
specific programs and to do that I will split the article into different
sections. Besides, there are many important tools that I will omit in my
*recipe*, but this is voluntary, if there isn't something it's simply because I
like its default configuration. Indeed I want to enfatize that this post shows a
personal point of view, so let's start:

This is a draft of the programs I'm going to install:

* i3wm
* glances
* ranger (with img2txt support)
* vim
* zsh
* chromium (with vimium)


:strike:`This is a work in progess post! There isn't (and probably there will
not be) a definitive version!`

Since I wrote this post years ago, when I was young and ingenuous, now things
are different. Now I'm using Dotdrop_, a dotfile manager written in Python, and
I'm hosting all my files in `this repository`_.

I'm going to keep here this post only because I'm fond of it, at the moment my
tastes are really different, for example I'm using Emacs instead of Vim and I
recently abandoned Xorg for Wayland with Sway_.
