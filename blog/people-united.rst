¡El pueblo unido jamás será vencido!

In these boring and useless days between Christmas and New Year's day I finally
decided to record myself playing the theme from `The people united will never be
defeated`_ by `Frederic Rzweski`_.
The piece is a set of 36 variations on the Chilean song "¡El pueblo unido jamás
será vencido!" by Sergio Ortega and Quilapayún. It's impossible not to see a
certain resemblance with the `Goldberg variations`_ by *J. S. Bach*.
Indeed, for example, the main theme on which the variations are built
is played again at the end of the variations, exactly as in the
Goldberg variations. Moreover the whole composition is full of
recursive patterns, e.g. the 36 variations are grouped by groups of
six and the latest variations of the first five groups sum up the the
first five variations of these five groups. At the end, in the last
group, the fist five variations sum up the latest variations of the
first five groups and the last variation sums up the first five variations
in the last group, in this way, the last variation contains all the
thirtyfive previous variations. A job worthy of Bach or Escher!

I have no musical pretensions, I'm not a musician and I studied this piece for
fun in my spare time. I also wanted to try to record the analog output of the
digital piano [#piano]_ using a normal integrated audio board, to check the
quality. I have to say that I'm pleasantly impressed by the low background
noise. I've used Audacity_ to record the audio and Openshot_ to put put together
the audio and the video.

It would have been cool to save the midi and then synthetize the audio, however
I had no fortune finding a good open source application to do that, I tried
FluidSynth with different soundfonts but the internal synthetizer of the piano
sounded better in my opinion. I intend to investigate further.

On the contrary, I found several nice and open source generic synthetizers, like
ZynAddSubFX_, despite I'm not into electronic music I like progressive rock and
related. Maybe one day I will spend some time on it...
