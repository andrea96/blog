However, maybe because I bought a new mechanical keyboard, maybe because I&amp;rsquo;m going to assemble a new pc for Christmas; this is a new post.

The first real project I tried was this Tetris implementation using Guile (yep, his sanctity Stallman should be proud of me), the code was is orrible but it allowed me to discover how to make things working pratically.

I&amp;rsquo;ve used a Canon 600D with the default 18-135mm lense, the photos were taken in raw mode and then processed using RawTherapee, an open source software I really appreciate.</description></item><item><title>Carousel</title><link>/posts/test-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 20:39:39 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/test-post/</guid><description>Welcome to this fantastic testing post, let&amp;rsquo;s start a carousel of functionalities:
You can create links implicitly, e.g. https://www.fsf.org/ or foo@bar.org. Otherwise there is the traditional way, i.e this.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to write in italic, in bold and in bold and italic, you can also strike the text.
But remember the koan:
A monk asked Zhaozhou Congshen, a Chinese Zen master: &amp;ldquo;Has a dog Buddha-nature or not?&amp;rdquo; Zhaozhou answered, &amp;ldquo;Mu&amp;rdquo;</description></item></channel></rss>
