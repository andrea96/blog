<h1><span class="title">The Zen and the art of the Unix hacking</span></h1>

<main>
<p>More than two months are passed since my last post, I had some good ideas I would have liked to transform into posts but I&rsquo;m afraid to be too lazy (in my defence I have to say that I&rsquo;ve been really busy).
However, maybe because I bought a new mechanical keyboard, maybe because I&rsquo;m going to assemble a new pc for Christmas; this is a new post.</p>

<p>As I preannunced, since I&rsquo;m building a new pc, I don&rsquo;t want to switch on my new computer for the first time without knowing which software to install, so the purpose of this post is to provide a <em>recipe</em> with my favorite softwares (and their configurations).</p>

<p>Obviously the operating system is <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">ArchLinux</a>, I&rsquo;ve been using it for 3-4 years and I still love it (and this says a lot).
I will not give information about the installation process nor the basic needed configurations, I want to focus on the specific programs and to do that I will split the article into different sections.
Besides, there are many important tools that I will omit in my <em>recipe</em>, but this is voluntary, if there isn&rsquo;t something it&rsquo;s simply because I like its default configuration.
Indeed I want to enfatize that this post shows a personal point of view, so let&rsquo;s start:</p>

<p>This is a draft of the programs I&rsquo;m going to install:</p>

<ul>
<li>i3wm</li>
<li>finch</li>
<li>glances</li>
<li>ranger (with img2txt support)</li>
<li>vim</li>
<li>zsh</li>
<li>chromium (with vimium)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a work in progess post! There isn&rsquo;t (and probably there will not be) a definitive version!</p>
