This isn’t really recent but it worths to be mentionated on this site, about one
month ago I started reading the [[https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/][fdf]] and I became obsessed with this
fantastic language. The first real project I tried was this Tetris
implementation using Guile (yep, his sanctity Stallman should be proud of me),
the code was is orrible but it allowed me to discover how to make things working
pratically. The SICP is a great book but it doesn’t offer any real world
example.
