In these boring and useless days between Christmas and New Year’s day
I finally decided to record myself playing the theme from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People_United_Will_Never_Be_Defeated!][The people
united will never be defeated]] by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Rzewski][Frederic Rzweski]].
The piece is a set of 36 variations on the Chilean song “¡El pueblo
unido jamás será vencido!” by Sergio Ortega and Quilapayún. It’s
impossible not to see a certain resemblance with the Goldberg
variations by J. S. Bach.
Indeed, for example, the main theme on which the variations are built
is played again at the end of the variations, exactly as in the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldberg_Variations][Goldberg variations]].
Moreover the whole composition is full of recursive patterns, e.g. the
36 variations are grouped by groups of six and the latest variations
of the first five groups sum up the the first five variations of these
five groups.
At the end, in the last group, the fist five variations sum up the
latest variations of the first five groups and the last variation sums
up the first five variations in the last group, in this way, the last
variation contains all the thirtyfive previous variations.
A job worthy of Bach or Escher!

I have no musical pretensions, I’m not a musician and I studied this
piece for fun in my spare time. I also wanted to try to record the
analog output of the digital piano[fn:1] 1 using a normal integrated
audio board, to check the quality. I have to say that I’m pleasantly
impressed by the low background noise. I’ve used [[https://www.audacityteam.org/][Audacity]] to record
the audio and [[https://www.openshot.org/][Openshot]] to put put together the audio and the video.

It would have been cool to save the midi and then synthetize the
audio, however I had no fortune finding a good open source application
to do that, I tried FluidSynth with different soundfonts but the
internal synthetizer of the piano sounded better in my opinion. I
intend to investigate further.

On the contrary, I found several nice and open source generic
synthetizers, like [[https://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.io/][ZynAddSubFX]], despite I’m not into electronic music
I like progressive rock and related. Maybe one day I will spend some
time on it...
