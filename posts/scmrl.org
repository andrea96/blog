Welcome to SCMRL (SCheMeRogueLike, yes I’ve to choose a more imaginative name),
in this page I will collect the information about this my project.

*2017/09/11* SCMRL is [[https://github.com/andrea96/scmrl][here on GitHub]]. This is the first commit, I worked on it at
the end of July and I decided to upload it only now. The game is not playable
but I feared that it could be accidentally deleted so here it is.

*May 2019* After nearly 2 years of nothing I started working again on this
project, I’m trying to create an object oriented interface (using [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/coops][coops]]) for the
already existing structures. I’m also making it compatible with [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/][Chicken 5]]. I
gave up about the idea of using the bugged [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/ncurses][nCurses]] egg and chose to directly do
the C calls to the library. At the moment I’m working on a new branch of the
repository.

Features implemented:

- Random dungeon generation inspired by [[http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/][this]]
- Field of vision based on [[http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Precise_Shadowcasting_in_JavaScript][this method]]
- Pathfinding via Dijkstra maps

I hope, sooner or later, to reach a playable version.
