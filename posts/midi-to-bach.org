You know these videos on YouTube where someone has recorded himself
playing every single notes and then, after days of editing, has
created a smooth video where he plays an entire song? They are usually
titled something like /1% music skills, 99% editing skills/.

Now I present my new video, which is /1% music skills, 1% editing
skills, 98% coding skills/, lo and behold:

{{{youtube(2ohxGVv6ngY)}}}

This video is generated by a Python script which mainly use two
libraries; [[https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy/][MoviePy]] for the video editing (based on ffmpeg) and [[https://github.com/mido/mido][mido]]
for the midi file reading.

You can find the source [[https://github.com/andrea96/midiToVideo][here on Github]], I created a repository only
for this, it also contains the source videos I used, so itâ€™s easier if
someone want to try playing with it without recording new videos (that
was the more boring part).

The source code is messy and full of hardcoded things which depends on
the specific midis, maybe one day I will create a specific Python
library for this.

Happy hacking
