More than two months are passed since my last post, I had some good ideas I would have liked to transform into posts but I'm afraid to be too lazy (in my defence I have to say that I've been really busy).
However, maybe because I bought a new mechanical keyboard, maybe because I'm going to assemble a new pc for Christmas; this is a new post.

As I preannunced, since I'm building a new pc, I don't want to switch on my new computer for the first time without knowing which software to install, so the purpose of this post is to provide a *recipe* with my favorite softwares (and their configurations).

Obviously the operating system is [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/), I've been using it for 3-4 years and I still love it (and this says a lot).
I will not give information about the installation process nor the basic needed configurations, I want to focus on the specific programs and to do that I will split the article into different sections.
Besides, there are many important tools that I will omit in my *recipe*, but this is voluntary, if there isn't something it's simply because I like its default configuration.
Indeed I want to enfatize that this post shows a personal point of view, so let's start:

This is a draft of the programs I'm going to install:

* i3wm
* finch
* glances
* ranger (with img2txt support)
* vim
* zsh
* chromium (with vimium)


This is a work in progess post! There isn't (and probably there will not be) a definitive version!
