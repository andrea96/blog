Welcome to this fantastic testing post, let's start a carousel of functionalities:

You can create links implicitly, e.g. <https://www.fsf.org/> or <foo@bar.org>.
Otherwise there is the traditional way, i.e [this](http://stallman.org/).

It's easy to write in *italic*, in **bold** and in ***bold and italic***, you can also ~~strike the text~~.

But remember the koan:

> A monk asked Zhaozhou Congshen, a Chinese Zen master: "Has a dog Buddha-nature or not?"
Zhaozhou answered, "Mu"

You can create unordered list...

- Something
- Something other

...and ordered:

1. First
+  Second
+  Third

Creating tables is easy too.

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

This is the biggest title
=========================

...and this is the smaller one
------------------------------

You can also break the page with a line:

Now let's start with the images:

Do you like math?

`$$ \frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{\sqrt{8}}{9801} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(4n)!}{(n!)^4}\times\frac{26390n + 1103}{396^{4n}} $$`

Support for syntax highlighting implemented via Javascript:

~~~c
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return 1;
    else 
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
~~~

I can stop now...
