Welcome to *SCMRL* (SCheMeRogueLike, yes I've to choose a more imaginative name), in this page I will collect the information about this my project.


***2017/09/11*** *SCMRL* is [here on GitHub](https://github.com/andrea96/scmrl).
This is the first commit, I worked on it at the end of July and I decided to upload it only now.
The game is not playable but I feared that it could be accidentally deleted so here it is.

Features implemented:

* Random dungeon generation inspired by [this](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/) 
* Field of vision based on [this method](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Precise_Shadowcasting_in_JavaScript)
* Pathfinding via Dijkstra maps

I hope to not abandon this project!
