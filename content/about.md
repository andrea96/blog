This is a personal site containing nothing interesting, there isn't a main topic; I'll simply upload anything that I want keep track 
of.
The site is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a cool static site generator, I realized this minimal theme using this pre-existing [theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) and [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a *barebones* CSS framework (yep I'm really funny).

This site is simple for ~~two~~ three reasons:

- the less features I implement the less feature I have to repair when something broke
- I'm a lazy man (ok, maybe this reason would be enough)
- Using Vim to write these posts is fantastic...

Ah, another thing: I'm not a native english speaker, so be clement please. Since I don't know what else to write I'll leave you with this hypnotic gif.
